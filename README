NAME
    Test::Memory::Usage - make sure code doesn't unexpectedly eat all your
    memory

VERSION
    version 0.0.1

SYNOPSIS
    The easiest usage pattern looks like this:

        use Test::Memory::Usage;

        # do some setup; decide that's roughly where you should be with usage
        # levels; draw your lin in the sand
        memory_usage_start;

        # do some things that you want to test as normal
        # ...
    
        # finally, make sure you haven't run away with memory
        memory_usage_ok;
        done_testing;

    You can call "memory_usage_start" as often as you like; each call moves
    the reference point used for comparison with "memory_usage_ok":

        # loop over some action and make sure it doesn't grow
        for (1 .. 5) {
            memory_usage_start;

            # bad growing code!
    
            memory_usage_ok(10);
        }

EXPORTS
    Test::Memory::Usage exports the following subs automatically:

    memory_usage_start
    memory_usage_ok
    memory_virtual_ok
    memory_rss_ok

METHODS
    The module provides the following methods:

    *   memory_usage_start

        This method records the current memory usage and flags it to be used
        for any growth tests later in the script.

        You can call the method multiple times; each call adds a new state
        record and updates makes the most recent state recorded the
        reference point for any growth comparisons

        This is useful if you want to compare the usage after you've
        performed a certain amount of minimum setup before the area(s) of
        code that you want to verify memory usage for.

    *   memory_usage_ok($percentage_limit)

        This calls the "memory_virtual_ok()" and "memory_rss_ok()"
        functions.

        If not provided $percentage_limit defaults to '10'.

    *   memory_virtual_ok($percentage_limit)

        Runs the test to ensure that virtual memory usage hasn't grown more
        than $percentage_limit

        This isn't usually called explicitly as most users will find
        "memory_usage_ok()" meets their testing needs.

        If not provided $percentage_limit defaults to '10'.

    *   memory_rss_ok($percentage_limit)

        Runs the test to ensure that RSS memory usage hasn't grown more than
        $percentage_limit

        This isn't usually called explicitly as most users will find
        "memory_usage_ok()" meets their testing needs.

        If not provided $percentage_limit defaults to '10'.
